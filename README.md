# ðŸŒŸ QUARKTIUM: Decentralizing the Galaxy ðŸŒŸ

As many other spheres are transitioning from the traditional ecosystem to a decentralized one enabled by the Blockchain technology and web3, the outer space or its representation on the mundane internet network should do the same. As a result of this vision, MetaStar was born.

The Quarktium project is made up several development versions which can be studied in detail in the official project documents, which will be included later in this repository.

This repository serves as a main hub that can be used as a guide to navigate directly to the repositories that contain the code that has been used to develop each version of the Quarktium project.

## VERSION 1: NFT Collection and Marketplace

The first version of the Quarktium project includes a NFT collection developed based upon a scientific foundation, the fundamentals of which are explained deeply in the official documents and in its corresponding repository, and a Marketplace where users can trade their stars.
